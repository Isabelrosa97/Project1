## Description
For this project we were tasked to create a webpage that meets both technical and workflow requirements. I have created a website for a fake crystal shop. This website consists of three pages, a home page, Shop (products) page, and a Join us (contacts) page. Each page was coded and styled to resemble and actual crystal shop page. 

## Functionality of Pages
- In the HOMEPAGE at the top of the page is the navbar that reads Home, Shop, and Contacts. There are also links in the carousel to go from the home page to either the products page or contacts page. There is also a shop link at the bottom of the page so the user has an option to shop without having to go back to the top of the page . All these links are for quick and easy travel throughout the website. There is also a back to top button at the bottom of the page incase the user wants to view whats at the top of the bage again without having to scroll. 

- In the SHOP page there is also a navbar at the top of the page for easy travel throughout the website. There are two sections of the page that have a heading that indicates whats being shown below. Below are the images of the products, description of the products, price, and an add to bag button for easy purchasing. There is also a Back to Top button at the bottom of the page so the user can jump back to the top without having to scroll much. 

- In the JOIN US page the navbar is at the top of the page for easy travel throughout the website. There is a form that has 2 text boxs and a drop box with a label next to each so the user knows what they are inputting. The name and email is required and will show a warning message indicating it must be filled out before submitting, if it was not filled out. This will help the user fill out the form correctly. There is also a survery that users can take to give the shop owner more insight in what is more popular for future product drops to keep customers happy. At the bottom there is a submit button that will generate the information in formspree and a clear button to erase what was typed in case a user made a mistake 

  ## Technologies Used
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - BootStrap
 
## Ideas for Future Improvement
To improve this website I would:
- Add more pictures to the homepage to show what else is offered to capture the users attention even more
- Instead of putting the products all in one page I would seperate the pages for a cleaner, more professional look
- Add a message box to the contacts page as well just in case a user wants to give feedback
- Create the wireframe on the computer instead of paper for a cleaner and more professional look
